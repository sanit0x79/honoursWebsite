                        <p>I am eager to be admitted into the honours program because of my passion for Cybersecurity and Computer Science. My interest in these fields
                            stem from the desire to help people and ensure their safety in cyberspace. My goal is to work for the government, where I can use my skills
                            to protect the world against cyber threats and make sure that our infrastructure lasts. By being part of this program I hope to further develop
                            these skills, and prepare myself for this future. <br>
                            My dedication, passion and commitment to making a postive impact might make me the ideal candidate for the honours program.</p>

                    <div id="section2" class="hidden mt-4">
                        <p>There are a few things I can bring to the honours program. The main one being my problem solving skills.
                            I do a lot of programming and programming involves a bunch of problem solving, it's something I've been getting a lot better
                            at in the past few years, and it is definitely something that could be of help during the projects we'll be doing during the honours program.
                            Another thing is my motivation and drive. I have a lot of motivation for projects and for learning. <br>
                            <br>For me learning new skills actually makes me happy. I am confident that my commitment to helping others
                            and my enthusiasm for learning will enable me to make meaningful contributions to the program.</p>

                    <div id="section3" class="hidden mt-4">
                        <p>When I'm not busy with studying, I'm usually working on my personal projects or I am at networking events. I like meeting new people and especially
                            if they are in the careerfield that I want to get into. Recently I had a dinner with CGI and talked over internship opportunities. I also went to a
                            workshop in hardware hacking and got to talk to an employee of WarpNet, a security company in Groningen and got the possiblity to do an intership there
                            in my third year. <br>
                            <br> I am currently busy with two projects. One being a cryptography toolkit that I'm making in python, named: "CryptoSuite".
                            And the other being a Discord Library to learn how to use websockets and API's. <br>You can click the projects below to get to the pages. <br> 
                            <br>On my GitHub there are also a few other projects that I have been working on, or have finished during my current time at the Hanze <br>
                            <br> <ul> <a href="https://github.com/sanit0x79/CryptoSuite">- Cryptosuite</a></ul> 
                            <ul><a href="https://github.com/sanit0x79/saniLib">- Discord Library</a></ul></p>

                    <div id="section4" class="hidden mt-4">
                        <p>The main thing I would like to gain from the honours program is the connections and networking possibilities. 
                            Networking is a really big part of my life and it's something I love doing, the honours program will help me with meeting 
                            new people and making new connections.<br>
                            <br>Joining the honours program would provide me with advanced knowledge and skills needed to excel in this field. I am excited about the opportunity 
                            to engage with like-minded people, and to be challenged academically.</p>
